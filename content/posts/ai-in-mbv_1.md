## Full Abstract
This chapter examines the impact that artificial intelligence (AI) has had on the domains of molecular biology and virology, as well as the recent breakthroughs that have occurred in these areas. As the capacities of data collection and processing continue to expand at an exponential rate, AI has emerged as a crucial instrument for addressing difficult biological concerns. The chapter highlights the importance that AI plays in furthering research and diagnostics by pointing its applications in gene sequence analysis, mutation prediction, antigen prediction, viral gene annotation, peptide-based vaccine development, protein structure prediction, phenotypic analysis, and other areas. This chapter also discusses the issues that AI is currently experiencing, including ethical implications, data quality, and the interpretability of models. The list of AI tools, along with brief explanations and potential application, is mentioned. In addition, this chapter offers an overview of a variety of artificial intelligence models, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble learning, as well as their applications in the field of biological data processing. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a complete overview of the existing and possible roles that AI plays in advancing research in the fields of biology and virology.
