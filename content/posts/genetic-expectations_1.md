## Summary
This paper presents a formal algebraic framework for modeling inheritance by
representing genotypes as probability measures rather than fixed states. This
novel approach allows for the computation of genetic expectations, a
probabilistic equivalent to the expected offspring distribution under
inheritance rules. The formulation enables constant-time simulation of
multi-locus inheritance and is capable of incorporating uncertainty in genotype
data. The framework accurately reproduces classical Mendelian outcomes and is
intended as a versatile computational and theoretical tool for genetic analysis
in research and educational settings.

## Contribution
- Authored the complete manuscript detailing a novel algebraic framework for
modeling genetic inheritance patterns, securing primary intellectual ownership.
- Developed and implemented the mathematical model, defining genotypes as
probability measures to enable constant-time simulation of multi-locus
inheritance.
- Independently designed and executed all eleven illustrative examples,
showcasing the framework's application to Mendelian and complex non-Mendelian
inheritance mechanisms.

## Full Abstract
This study introduces a formal framework for modeling inheritance patterns based on an algebraic representation of genotype distributions. The approach defines genotypes as probability measures rather than discrete states, enabling the computation of genetic expectations, a probabilistic analogue that captures the expected distribution of offspring genotypes under Mendelian inheritance rules. This formulation permits constant-time simulation of multi-locus inheritance processes and provides a means of incorporating uncertainty and partial information in genotype data. A series of eleven illustrative examples is presented, encompassing both Mendelian and selected non-Mendelian mechanisms, including polygenic inheritance, uniparental disomy, and haplodiploidy. While the current framework does not model recombination, linkage, or phenotypic traits, it is designed to accommodate extensions to some complex chromosomal structures, such as those encountered in polysomic inheritance. The model reproduces classical inheritance outcomes and is intended as a computational and theoretical tool for genetic analysis in both research and pedagogical settings. Future development will focus on increasing biological scope and integrating empirical data sources.
