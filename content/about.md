  Hi there! I’m Nakul, a computer science student at Manipal—a researcher by
  trade and a typesetter by passion.

  My research revolves around bioinformatics, where I’m part of several major projects,
  along with a few of my own. Research, to me, is simply the formal expression
  of the curiosity that brought me joy (and a bit of trouble) as a kid.

  I work extensively with LaTeX and even designed my website to resemble a
  LaTeX document—a small tribute to the system that shaped how I think about
  writing and structure.

  On most days, you can find me awake before dawn—the tranquil silence of a
  still sleeping world helps me think. You might also bump into me on a run or
  a cycling trip, hobbies that keep my mind in check. 

  The best way to contact me is through my email: nakulbhat034 [at] gmail [dot]
  com
