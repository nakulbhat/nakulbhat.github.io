transformation, made possible by the massive amounts of data now accessible for
analysis. This book chapter, written under the guidance of Dr. S. Balaji, Head
of the Department of Biotechnology, provides an introduction to the
fundamentals of AI for molecular biologists and virologists. It explores the
increasing influence of AI in these domains, showcasing its applications in key
areas like gene sequence analysis, protein structure prediction, and phenotypic
analysis. This review highlights how AI is fundamentally changing the landscape
of biological research and diagnostics.</p><h2 id=navigating-the-complexities-of-ai-in-biology>Navigating the Complexities of AI in Biology</h2><p>While AI offers immense potential, its integration into biological research
presents a unique set of complexities. This chapter discusses critical
challenges, including the paramount importance of biological data quality, the
issue of interpreting complex AI models, and the significant ethical
considerations that arise when using AI for sensitive biological applications.
Understanding and discussing these topics is crucial for the responsible and
effective deployment of AI technologies.</p><h2 id=a-toolkit-of-modern-ai-methods>A Toolkit of Modern AI Methods</h2><p>To provide a comprehensive overview, the chapter details the modern AI tools
and models that are gaining traction in molecular biology and virology. It
offers a detailed look at various techniques, including neural networks,
supervised and unsupervised learning, decision trees, and ensemble learning.
For each tool, the chapter discusses its current applications, potential future
uses, and how it can accelerate scientific breakthroughs. This section serves
as a practical guide for researchers looking to leverage these powerful
technologies.</p><h2 id=access-the-full-publication>Access the Full Publication</h2><p>For a complete and detailed understanding of AI&rsquo;s role in advancing both
research and practical solutions in these critical scientific domains, we
