    During the compilation of a <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> document, several auxiliary files
    are produced, each containing information about the typesetting process. This
    website is organized in a similar style and includes details about my
    projects and setup. The look and feel of this website is meant to mimick a the
    standard LaTeX article class (with a little artistic interpretation). 


    You can visit [about](/about/) and [research](/research/) to learn more
    about me and my work. The best way to contact me is by email, which you’ll
    find in my [resume](/resume.pdf).
